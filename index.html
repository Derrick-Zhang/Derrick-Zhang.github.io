    <h1>$SU(6)$ and the Quark Model</h1>

    <p>
    In the spectrum of low-lying baryons, the octet with spin $1/2$ and the decuplet with spin $3/2$ are not very far apart in mass.
    Inspired by this, physicists believed that embedding $SU(3)$ in larger symmetry group would connect the two representations.
    </p>

    <h2>Including the spin</h2>

    <p>
    The natural way to extend $SU(3)$ symmetry is to include the quark spin in the quark state, in addition to the quark type.
    So we can think about a 6 dimensional tensor product space in which the states have an $SU(3)$ index, and a spin index,
    $$(|u\rangle,|d\rangle,|s\rangle)(|1/2\rangle,|-1/2\rangle).$$
    The corresponding symmetry group is an $SU(6)$ symmetry that acts on this six dimensional tensor product space. 
    The generators include the $SU(3)$ generators $\frac{1}{2}\lambda_a$ with identity in spin space, and the spin generators 
    $\frac{1}{2}\sigma_j$ with the identity in the $SU(3)$ space. The other $SU(6)$ generators are the products $\frac{1}{2}\lambda_a \sigma_j$.
    </p>

    <h2>$SU(N)\times SU(M) \in SU(NM)$</h2>

    <p>
    For $SU(NM)$, the defining representation has $NM$ indices, we can therefore describe it in a tensor product space,
    replacing the $NM$ indices by an ordered pairs of indices, $i,x$ where $i$ runs from $1$ to $N$ and $x$ runs from $1$ to $M$.
